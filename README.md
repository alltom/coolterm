A small terminal made for fun
=============================

![screencast](https://raw.github.com/alltom/coolterm/master/screencast.gif)

The aim is a terminal for OS X that uses the native text editor widget and inherits some of the nice features of Plan 9 terminal:

* History is editable
* Output does not scroll automatically

It's not done. See BUGS.md

(CoolTerm is a code name!)
